Thin wrapper around the "aws" command line interface (CLI) for use with LocalStack.

The "awslocal" CLI allows you to easily interact with your local services without
having to specify "--endpoint-url=http://..." for every single command.

Example:
Instead of the following command ...
aws --endpoint-url=https://localhost:4568 --no-verify-ssl kinesis list-streams
... you can simply use this:
awslocal kinesis list-streams

Options:
  Run "aws help" for more details on the aws CLI subcommands.
